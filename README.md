# Snake Game (C++)

A classic Snake game implemented in C++ as a console application. The player controls the snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, game loops, and real-time input handling.

## Features
- Real-time snake movement controlled via keyboard arrow keys.
- Dynamic food spawning with score tracking.
- Collision detection with walls and self.
- Modular code structure separating game logic, input handling, and rendering.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming, Game Loops, Collision Detection, Console Input/Output
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, g++ Compiler

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository (or download the project folder).  
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred C++ IDE).  
3. Compile all `.cpp` files using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ -o snake main.cpp snake.cpp game.cpp
4. Run the executable: ./snake
5.
